<p>If you have any doubts as to the amount of memory actually used by any variable (and this goes for types we'll discuss later, also), you can use the sizeof operator to find out for sure. (For completeness, it is important to mention that sizeof is a unary operator, not a function.)</p>
<p> Its syntax is:

sizeof object
sizeof(type)</p>
<p>The two expressions above return the size of the object and type specified, in bytes. The return type is size_t (defined in the header <stddef.h>) which is an unsigned value.</p>
<p> Here's an example usage:

size_t size;
int i;
size = sizeof(i);
size will be set to 4, assuming CHAR_BIT is defined as 8, and an integer is 32 bits wide.</p>
<p> The value of sizeof's result is the number of bytes.</p>
</p>Note that when sizeof is applied to a char, the result is 1; that is:

sizeof(char)
always returns 1.</p>
