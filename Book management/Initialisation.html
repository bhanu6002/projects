<div class="border_box">
You can initialize array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows:<br>

double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};<br>
The number of values between braces { } can not be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].<br>

If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write:<br>

double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};<br>
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array:

balance[4] = 50.0;<br>
<p>The above statement assigns element number 5th in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called base index and last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. <p>
