 <p>C arrays allow you to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind but structure is another user defined data type available in C programming, which allows you to combine data items of different kinds.</p>

Structures are used to represent a record, Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book:<br>

Title<br>

Author<br>

Subject<br>

Book ID<br>

<b>Defining a Structure</b><br>
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member for your program. The format of the struct statement is this:<br>

struct [structure tag]<br>
{<br>
   member definition;<br>
   member definition;<br>
   ...<br>
   member definition;<br>
} [one or more structure variables];  <br>
<p>The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure:</p>

struct Books<br>
{<br>
   char  title[50];<br>
   char  author[50];<br>
   char  subject[100];<br>
   int   book_id;<br>
} book;  <br>
Accessing Structure Members<br>
<p>To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use struct keyword to define variables of structure type. Following is the example to explain usage of structure:</p>

#include <stdio.h><br>
#include <string.h><br>
 
struct Books<br>
{<br>
   char  title[50];<br>
   char  author[50];<br>
   char  subject[100];<br>
   int   book_id;<br>
};<br>
 
<h3><b>Structures as Function Arguments</b></h3><br>
You can pass a structure as a function argument in very similar way as you pass any other variable or pointer. You would access structure variables in the similar way as you have accessed in the above example:<br>

#include <stdio.h><br>
#include <string.h><br>
 
struct Books<br>
{<br>
   char  title[50];<br>
   char  author[50];<br>
   char  subject[100];<br>
   int   book_id;<br>
};<br>
